# Improvements

Attempt the following improvements:

+ When the program starts up, all the segments are turned on (Eight). It should have no segments turned on. Update the code to set all segments to HIGH when the program starts up. Try to use a function to do this. 

+ Update the program to count the number of times the button has been pressed and output it to the Serial monitor. 

+ Go online and research what "debouncing" means. Have a look at our code for the line of code that provides debouncing.
