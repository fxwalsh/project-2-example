# State Change and Buttons

In the last step you used a simple button to display a random number on the 7 segment display. 
In this step, we will improve this functionality by getting it to calculate a number just when a "change" is detected in the button pin. This happens when the button is pressed (goes from LOW to HIGH) and when it is released (goes from HIGH to LOW).

+ We need variables to track both the current and last button state. Add the following variables to the variable list at the top of the program:

~~~c
int lastButtonState = LOW;
~~~

+ Replace the entire contents of the Loop() function with the following:

~~~c
    // read the state of the pushbutton value
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
   // check if button state has changed (pressed or let go)
   if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      // if the current state is HIGH, then the button
      // went from off to on
        // display a random number between 0-9
    	int randomNumber=random(0,10);
    	display(randomNumber);
    	digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    	Serial.println(randomNumber);
    } else {
      // if the current state is LOW, then the button
      // went from on to off
      	Serial.println("off");
      	digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    }
    // delay a little bit to avoid debouncing
    delay(5); // Wait for 5 millisecond(s)
  }
  // save the current state as the last state, for
  // the next time through the loop
  lastButtonState = buttonState;

~~~
The above code uses the ``currentState`` and ``lastState`` variables to check if the button "state" has changed. If it has moved from LOW->HIGH then it outputs the random number.

+ Run the code again and check the output ion the serial console:

You will notice that the number on the 7 seg display changes when you press the button and not when you leave go.
