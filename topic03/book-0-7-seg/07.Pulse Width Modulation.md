# Pulse Width Modulation

In this step you will attach a LED to digital pin 5 and control its brightness using the potentiometer.

+ In Tinkercad, have a look at this example:

+ Try to incorporate this into your current project. You will need to add an LED on digital Pin 5 as shown.
+ Update your code to write the mapped value from the Potentiometer to the LED pin.
