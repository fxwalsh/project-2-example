# Display a Random Number

In this step you will display a random number by pressing a button.

+ Leave the circuit as it is from the last step.
+ Add a button connected to Pin 5 as highlighted in the diagram below:

We will update the code for our program to test the button and get it to turn the LED on the board (connected to pin 13) on and off. This is a toggle button. 

+ Add the following constants above the ``setup()`` function:

~~~c
const int buttonPin = 5;    // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin = 13;      // the number of the onboard LED pin
~~~

+ Now, replace the contents of the ``loop()`` function with the following:

~~~c
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    // calculate and display a random number between 0-9
    int randomNumber=random(0,10);
    display(randomNumber);
  } else {
    // turn LED off
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
  delay(10); // Delay a little bit to improve performance performance
~~~

Upload the code to the Board. You should see a random number generated every time you press the button.

## Serial Output

Lets output the result of the random number selection to the **Serial Console** in the Arduino IDE.

Your Arduino IDE uses *Asynchronous Serial Communication* to communicate with the Arduino Uno across the USB cable connected to your computer. 

We can also use Serial Communication to get data back from the Arduino and on to your computer. In this case, we'll get the random number generated:

+ Add the following line of code at the bottom of your ``setup()`` function:

~~~c
// initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
~~~

+ Add the following line of code in the ``loop()`` function, just under the ``display(randomNumber);`` statement.

~~~c
Serial.println(randomNumber);
~~~

+ Upload the program and Run. Now open the **Serial Monitor** window. This will listen on the COM port for output from the Arduino. Press the button and see what happens:

So you'll notice that every time you hit the button, lots of random numbers appear. You'll also see the 7 seg display flicker at it attempts to display all the numbers.

+ Review the code and try to figure out why this happens?
