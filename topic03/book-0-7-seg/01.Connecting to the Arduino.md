# Connecting 7-Seg Display

Single digit seven segment displays have 10 pins. Two pins connect to either ground (common cathode) or Vcc(common anode). The other 8 connect to each of the segments:

Before you can connect your display to the Arduino, you need to know if itâ€™s common anode or common cathode, and which pins connect to each segment. This information should be in the datasheet. 

- Examine your 7 seg display and try to figure out which one it is( hint: use the serial/product numbers on it)

## Wire it up

Go to the following project on Tinkerca and use the diagram to wire up the 7 Seg display(use this diagram or click on it to open the Tinkercad project).

Examine the circuit. Notice that the segments are connected to the arduino as follows:

~~~
a -> 11;
b -> 12;
c -> 2;
d -> 3;
e -> 6;
f -> 10;
g -> 9;
~~~

+ Now, connect your arduino to your computer and open Arduino IDE.
+ Do **File -> New**.
+ Copy and Paste the following code into the Editor.
~~~c
const int a = 11;
const int b = 12;
const int c = 2;
const int d = 3;
const int e = 6;
const int f = 10;
const int g = 9;

//Set all segment pins for output
void setup()
{
  pinMode(a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(b, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(c, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(d, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(e, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(f, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(g, OUTPUT);

}

//Function to display integer number on 7 seg display
void display(int i) {
  if (i == 1) {
    digitalWrite(a, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(b, LOW);
    digitalWrite(c, LOW);
    digitalWrite(d, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(e, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(f, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(g, HIGH);
  }
  if (i == 2) {
    digitalWrite(a, LOW);
    digitalWrite(b, LOW);
    digitalWrite(c, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(d, LOW);
    digitalWrite(e, LOW);
    digitalWrite(f, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(g, LOW);
  }
}

void loop()
{
  display(1);
  delay(1000);
  display(2);
  delay(1000);
}
~~~

Examine the ``display()`` function. Notice that we set segments b and c to **LOW** and all others to **HIGH**. This turns the b and c segments ON and turns all others off. 

+ Based on the code above, add more ``if`` statements to the ``display`` function for all other digits (0-9).
  
+ Update the loop() display all digits from 9 to 0. Why not use a ``for`` or ``while`` loop to do this. You can find out how [here](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

Once complete, save your code.
