## Include the Twilio code

So every time the button is pressed, **we want to send just 1 SMS**. Here are some use case scenarios we need to think about before coding this:

1. What if someone keeps their finger on the button
2. What if someone presses the button repeatedly, really fast.
3. What if someone presses the button, waits for 30 seconds(gets no answer), and then presses it again.

Run the program, they the above scenarios,  and see what the output in the console looks like. In all of these cases to probably only want to send one SMS message, not loads of them!

We need to take account of this when we code the button. One approach could be one of the following:
1. Create a variable called last_SMS_Time and use it to record the last time an SMS was sent using Twilio
2. Everytime the button is pressed, send a message and wait for 30 seconds.

+ In Wyliodrin Studio, Update the "Connected Button" application as shown below. Use the same values for Account, Token, To and From as you did in your "Twilio Test" application (you can get them from the Twilio Dashboard again).

Test the program to check that it works. Make sure you receive a SMS when you press the button. You should see "Message Sent" in the Wyliodrin console every time a message is sent. The delay ensures repeated messages are not sent. 

## Improve the message. 

We would like to include the date and time the button was pressed in the SMS message, instead of just "hello!"

+ In Wyliodrin, create a variable called ``last_SMS_Time``.

+ Add the following code blocks indicated in the diagram below to assign the time to the ``last_SMS_Time`` variable and send it in the SMS message

Test your program again. The SMS will now have the hour and minute the button was pressed.

# Exercise

Using the "Make a Call To..." code block from Twilio,  change your program so that it also calls you with the same message you used in the SMS. To do this, you will need to  enable Ireland as a destinations you can call.  
+ Open the Twilio Dashboard, go to **Programmable Voice -> Geo Permissions** and select **Ireland**
