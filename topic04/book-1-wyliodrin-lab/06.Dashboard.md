# Wyliodrin Dashboard

The dashboard allows you to visualise data generated from your program. To to this, you use "signals" in the Wyliodrin project.

- Stop your program.
- Find the **Signals** block group and add the "Send signal" block to the program as shown in the diagram.

- Click on the **Dashboard**. Put a **Gauge** on the dash board and configure it to display the **light** signal:

- Run your program again. You should now see the gauge display the light level and vary as you cover/uncover the light sensor.

  ## Exercises

1.  Display the values coming from the light sensor in the dashboard using the **Line** graph. Configure it to display a maximum of 100 data points  
2.  Display the value you are sending to the LED on Pin 3. 
3.  Experiment with connecting other sensors in the kit(thermistor/Potentiometer) to the Arduino and display the values you read in the dashboard. **Note:** Do not connect the Hall sensor, which works in a different way.
