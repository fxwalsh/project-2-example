# Firmata

As previously stated, the classical Arduino board is basically a micro-controller, which is capable of running one piece of software at once and that has little processing power and no network connectivity. So you will use the board to gather data from the environment and then pass it on to the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi is a computer that is capable of processing data and communicating with other smart devices and cloud-based services like Twitter. For instance, you could visualise the temperature on your smart phone.

##  Connecting the Pi and Arduino


The two boards need to be connected in order to send data between them. You can connect them via the USB cable and a serial connection will be established between the two. Once this is done, they can exchange data and the Arduino board can be controlled via the Raspberry Pi(**Dont connect them yet!!!**). 

## Arduino Setup

The **firmata** protocol allows the Raspberry Pi to send the Arduino messages in which it requests for a certain action or information and the Arduino will respond accordingly.

In order to implement the protocol, you need to flash the Arduino with the **StandardFirmata** firmware.

Follow the instructions for flashing Standard Firmata here. You will have already completed some of the steps in the previous labs:

### RPi Setup 

You will need the **pyFirmata** libraries on your Raspberry Pi.

Connect your RPi to the Wyliodrin Studio and install the relevant library as shown below:

Once this is complete, you're all set to connect the RPi to the Arduino.
