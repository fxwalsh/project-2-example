The lab requires a Twitter account but if you don't have one and do not want to create one, you can skip the ThingTweet and React steps.

In this lab you will

- Create a Thingspeak account
- Create a Thingspeak Channel and write data
- Create a Twitter API (ThingTweet) for status updates
- Create a Thingspeak *React* that triggers actions
- Create a IFTTT Webhook and integrate with ThingSpeak channel.
