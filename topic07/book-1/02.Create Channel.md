# Thingspeak Channel

You are going to create a channel for environmental data from your SenseHAT in ThingSpeak called the â€œSensePi Channel".

## Create a Channel

- Click on *New Channel* button and Name the channel and Field1 as shown below. In this exercise, we will only receive data on one variable (temperature), so only one field is needed.

-  Scroll to the bottom and click *Save Channel*. Your screen should now look like below. Next, click the *API Keys* tab.

This is where the API Keys and the Channel ID for this particular channel are located. We will use these keys (the Channel ID, the Write API Key and the Read API Key) for our code.

## Test your Channel

Notice, on the right of the *API Keys* tab you are provided with some prebuild API requests constructed using your API keys.

- Copy and paste **just the ULR part** from the *Write a Channel Feed* into a browser window. Set field1=20 and hit "Enter".

- Now, in Thingspeak, check the *private view* tab for the SensePi channel. You should see the value written from the Web browser:

- Using the same technique as above, push a few more values. You will see the data visualised as a line graph by default in Thingspeak. **FYI: For users of the free option, the message update interval limit is limited at 15 seconds - you will get a "0" returned if you try to update any sooner.**
