# Automatic Email via IFTTT

In this step you will use a React app  to trigger an HTTP request to IFTTT in ThingHTTP. You will create specific email of channel activity from ThingSpeak data. 

IFTTT(If this then that) lets you create *applets*(think of them as small apps) that act in response to another action. You can use the IFTTT *Webhooks* service to create web requests to trigger an action. The incoming action is an HTTP request to the web server, and the outgoing action is an email to your account. 

## If This...
+ Create an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) account if you do not already have one (you can use your Google ID if you have one).  
+ Log in to your account. Go to your home page and click **Create** and then click "Add" 
![Add IFTTT](./img/ifthis.png)
+ Select the Webhooks service. Enter Webhooks in the search field. Select the Webhooks card. After you select Webhooks as the trigger, click the "Receive a web request" card to continue.

+ Enter the event name "TooHot". Click Create Trigger.

## Then That...

+  To Select the resulting action, click on "Add"" in the Then That card.

+  Enter "Email" in the search bar, and click the Notifications box. Then select "Send me an email" card and enter your email address.  
![Choose Action Service IFTTT](./img/email.png)  
+ Follow the instuctions to set up and connect your email address.

+ Update the subject and body of the event email as shown, or add whatever text you want...

+ Finally, click Continunue followed by finish. You should now have a connected IFTTT Service. 


## Get the trigger URL
+ To retrieve the URL for the Service(or "webhook"), click on your user icon in the top left corner and select  "Services"   
![My Services IFTTT](./img/ser.png)
+ Scroll down and select "webhooks" and then click on the "Documentation" icon"
![Documentation IFTTT](./img/doc.png)
+ You'll see your key and the format of the URL you need to request. Enter the event name(TooHot).

You can test the service using the test button or by using the Curl command. 

# Create a ThingHTTP

To complete the trigger request, create a ThingHTTP. The ThingHTTP app lets you trigger predefined HTTP requests with an API key and a GET request from the web or from a device. For this example, use ThingHTTP to trigger your Webhook at IFTTT.

 + Open your SensePi channel in ThingSpeak
 
 +  Choose Apps => ThingHTTP, and select New ThingHTTP.

+ Edit your ThingHTTP settings.

    Name - Name your ThingHTP.

    URL - Enter the URL from the Webhooks documentation. The URL for this example has the form https://maker.ifttt.com/triigger/TooHOT/with/key/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.

    Method - Enter GET.

![ThingHTTP](./img/http.png)

+ If you want o send custom values in your message from IFTTT, add value1=YOUR_VALUE to the Body field. Change YOUR_VALUE to the value or text you want to send.

+ Save the ThingHTTP.

## Create a React to Your Data

Create a React app to trigger the ThingHTTP based on your channel data. 

The React app can evaluate your ThingSpeak channel data and trigger other events. Create an instance of the React app that triggers when the SensePi reports temperature greater than 30 degrees(Too Hot). 

+ In Thingspeak in your channel, choose Apps > React, and then click New React and fill out as follows:
  
  ![React for IFTTT](./img/tempreact.png)

Once the temperature in the channel reaches the set point for your React, you'll receive an email. It will only happen the first time the condition is met.

## Testing

You can test each component separately.

1.  **Trigger Webhooks at IFTTT from your browser.** If you copy the address from the Webhooks documentation to your browser address window. IFTTT will respond with "You have successfully triggered the TooHot event!"

2. Trigger your ThingHTTP using a Web API call. The format for the call is available on the help pane after you edit and save your ThingHTTP. Your ThingHTTP has a unique API key.

GET https://api.thingspeak.com/apps/thinghttp/send_request?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

3. Trigger your React by writing data to your channel that fits the conditions specified in your React. For example, you can write a temperature of 49 degrees to field 1.

GET https://api.thingspeak.com/apps/thinghttp/send_request?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&field1=49
