# Circuit 1

Wire up the experiment as shown in fig.1.
![fig.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truhlikfredy/IoTlabs/master/2%20-%20button/Images/button.png)

# Code
In the Arduino IDE, create a new sketch and enter the following code:

```
int led = 13;

void setup() {                
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);     
}


void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  
}
```

Note that we do not take input from the button here - we are just using the board and output pin  to provide power to drive the circuit. In the next stoe we will read in the state of the pushbutton to our program.
